## Projects
### Competitive Multiplayer Game (MySQL, Java)

Collaborated with 4 peers to develop a real-time, competitive shooter inspired by Bomberman and Wii Play's "Tanks!". Features a fully-fledged lobby system, statistics collection and a bundled map collector. Created and maintained the logic for the server and database to allow for intercommunication between users in a local network and the collection of the player's statistics such as games won, number of deaths, etc. Tracked and stored 50+ game session statistics over a great variety of players. 

### Linux-based ETL Pipeline (Linux)

Developed an automated ETL pipeline using Bash scripting to process and standardize transaction data from a remote server, reducing the time to process this information by 70%. Extracted a compressed source file via scp, decompressed it with bunzip2, and performed data transformations using various Linux utilies including header removal and text normalization, data validation and filtering, and currency symbol cleanup and numeric field handling. Generated three reports using awk: 1) Transaction Summary: Aggregated purchases by state, age group, and gender. 2) Transaction Count Report: State-wise breakdown of transaction frequencies. 3) Purchase Total Report: Total amount of purchases grouped by state and gender.

### 2020-2025 COVID-19 Analysis (SQL, Excel, Tableau)

Collected and cleaned global COVID cases and vaccination data from 2020 to 2025 from OurWorldInData. Designed SQL queries using CTEs to analyze relationships between vaccination rates and mortality, assess changes in reproduction rates pre and post vaccine rollouts, and evaluate policy effectiveness across countries and continents. Created and visualized four insights via Tableau, such as the association between greater than 50% vaccination coverage and the reduction of deaths per million people, and identified which continents rolled out vaccinations proactively relative to its peak infection date.
